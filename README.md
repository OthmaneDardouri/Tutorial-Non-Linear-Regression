# Non-Linear Regression Using Scikit-Learn: A Simple Tutorial

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement non-linear regression models using scikit-learn. We will experiment with polynomial regression of degrees 2, 3, and 4 to understand how increasing model complexity affects predictions. The goal is to build and evaluate models that predict the demand for a product based on temperature data.

This tutorial is beginner-friendly and introduces essential techniques for working with polynomial regression. For more advanced topics, stay tuned for future notebooks exploring other non-linear regression approaches.

## Dataset

We will use a simple dataset containing two features:

Temperature: the independent variable (predictor).

Demand: the dependent variable (target).

This dataset is commonly used for regression tasks to demonstrate the relationship between a numerical predictor and response variable.

## Notebook and Code

The primary objective of this notebook is to:

Visualize the relationship between temperature and demand.

Train and evaluate non-linear regression models using polynomial regression with degrees 2, 3, and 4.

Compare the performance of these models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.

We will explore how well each polynomial degree captures the relationship between temperature and demand.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (preferably version 3.x)

scikit-learn: To install, run pip install scikit-learn

pandas: To install, run pip install pandas

seaborn: To install, run pip install seaborn

matplotlib: To install, run pip install matplotlib

Familiarity with Python and basic data manipulation using pandas is helpful but not mandatory.

## Getting Started

Load the Dataset: Use pandas to load and explore the temperature-demand dataset.

Visualize the Data: Create scatter plots using seaborn or matplotlib to observe the relationship between temperature and demand.

Preprocess the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train Polynomial Regression Models:

Polynomial degree 2

Polynomial degree 3

Polynomial degree 4

Use scikit-learnâ€™s PolynomialFeatures and LinearRegression classes.

Evaluate and Compare Models:

Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values to measure model performance.

Visualize the model predictions against the actual data.

## Conclusion

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

Understand how to implement polynomial regression using scikit-learn.

Learn how the complexity of a polynomial regression model (degree) impacts predictions.

Be able to evaluate regression models based on performance metrics and visualize the results.

Happy coding and enjoy exploring non-linear regression!
